# Hospital-Mortality-Prediction

The predictors of in-hospital mortality for intensive care units (ICU)-admitted HF patients remain poorly characterized.  
We aimed to develop and validate a prediction model for all-cause in-hospital mortality among ICU-admitted HF patients.  
We will be using different ML models and then PyCaret Auto ML Library to predict the results in this notebook.
Time Line of the Project:
* Data Analysis
* Data Preprocessing
* Model Building and Prediction using ML models
* Model Building and Prediction using PyCaret
